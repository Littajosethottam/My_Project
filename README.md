# Background Information

## GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages is a free service provided by GitHub that allows you to host web pages directly from a GitHub repository. It is commonly used for hosting project documentation, personal websites, and blogs. By leveraging GitHub Pages, you can create a static website that is easy to maintain and update.

Key Features:

Free Hosting: Host your static websites for free. Version Control: Easily track changes and collaborate using Git. Custom Domains: Use a custom domain for your website. Markdown Support: Write content in Markdown for simplicity and readability. To use GitHub Pages, you create a repository on GitHub, add your website files, and enable GitHub Pages in the repository settings. Your site is then accessible at `https://littajosethottam.github.io/My_Project/`

## Quarto

Quarto is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system that can create dynamic documents, reports, presentations, and websites. It supports multiple languages, including R, Python, and Julia, and is designed to be highly extensible and customizable. Quarto websites are built from simple Markdown files and can be easily deployed to platforms like GitHub Pages.

Key Features:

Multilingual Support: Write content in R, Python, Julia, and more. Extensible: Highly customizable with themes and extensions. Integrated Publishing: Create websites, blogs, books, and presentations. https://quarto.org/

# Your Website (10 points)

You create your own personal website and host it on GitHub Pages. I recommend Quarto for building the website, but other R packages are available and allowed.

You have to create your own GitHub account. You can use your name. You do not have to buy and use a custom domain. The structure` https://<username>.github.io/<repository>` is perfectly fine.

Your website should contain tabs or subpages. Use at least one image. Use some CV information. If you don’t feel comfortable using your real personal information, you may use fake information.

# Official Quarto Guides

Creating and hosting a personal website using Quarto involves two main steps: building the website and hosting it. Follow the guides below to complete each step effectively. You may also follow any other guide you find.

## Build the website
To start building your website, you’ll use Quarto, a powerful tool for creating websites from Markdown files. This process is very similar to other project types in RStudio, so you should find it familiar if you’ve used RStudio before.

## Host the website

Once you have built your website, the next step is to host it so that it is accessible online. GitHub Pages is a popular and free option for hosting static websites.
